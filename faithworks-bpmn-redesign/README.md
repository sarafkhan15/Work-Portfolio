# Optimising Faith-Driven Operations â€“ FaithWorks BPMN Case Study
*A process improvement **and** redesign project for a non-profit food relief store, blending community service with practical digital transformation.*

---

## About the Project
FaithWorks Food Assist is a volunteer-run food relief store in Adelaide. Every day, they rescue and redistribute donated food to 180â€“200 families, offering low-cost meals and groceries.

While their impact is huge, their operations were almost entirely manual â€” relying on verbal instructions, paper notes, and the experience of a few key people. That meant:
- Inconsistent service
- Slow checkouts
- Repetitive manual work
- Limited tracking of stock and sales

Our goal was two-fold:
1. **Process Improvement** â€“ Make the existing way of working faster, more consistent, and less error-prone.  
2. **Process Redesign** â€“ Reimagine how the core processes could work with the right tools and structure in place.

---

## What We Did
We applied the **Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle** to map, analyse, improve, and redesign two critical processes:

1. **Categorical Sorting, Quality Control & Strategic Storage**  
   *(From receiving donations â†’ sorting â†’ storage â†’ store shelves)*

2. **Customer Service & Checkout**  
   *(From membership verification â†’ checkout â†’ payment â†’ post-service yard access)*

For each process, we:
- Created **AS-IS** diagrams to document the current workflow and identify bottlenecks.  
- Proposed **improvement measures** for quick wins that could be implemented immediately.  
- Designed **TO-BE** diagrams for a redesigned process using barcode-enabled inventory management and cloud-based POS systems for long-term scalability.

## Key Improvements & Redesign Highlights
| Area | Before (AS-IS) | Improvement Actions | Redesigned (TO-BE) |
|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Inventory tracking | Paper/memory | Basic process documentation | Barcode scanning in IMS with real-time updates |
| Sorting & allocation | Manual, repetitive | Remove unnecessary handovers | IMS suggests optimal allocation; team confirms |
| Checkout | Slow & error-prone | Staff refresher training | POS auto-applies free item rules and calculates charges |
| Produce weighing | Manual calc | Clearer weighing rules | Integrated scale updates POS instantly |
| Receipts | Handwritten/skipped | Standardised templates | Printed or SMS receipts |
| Exceptions | Ad-hoc fixes | Fallback checklists | Defined fallbacks for system or hardware issues |

---

## Impact We Expect
- **From improvements:** Immediate gains in consistency, fairness, and reduced stress for volunteers.  
- **From redesign:** Scalable, data-driven processes that can handle growth without losing community focus.

- ðŸ“Š [Presentation Slides (PPTX)](docs/Presnetation.pptx) â€“ quick visual overview

---

## My Role
- Led the **process improvement and redesign** work for both core processes  
- Created BPMN diagrams for redesigned workflows  
- Developed improvement strategies for immediate implementation  
- Wrote recommendations and change management steps  
- Conducted and summarised stakeholder interviews

---

## Tech & Tools
- **BPMN 2.0** for process modelling  
- **Zoho Inventory** (recommended) for barcode inventory  
- **Cloud POS** for checkout automation (with manual fallback)  

---

## Next Steps for FaithWorks
- Implement the **quick improvements** immediately  
- Pilot the redesigned processes in one area  
- Train volunteers on barcode scanning & POS use  
- Expand gradually based on data and feedback
