SAP S/4HANA ERP Implementation – Predictive Maintenance (FutureEnergy)

This project is a practical blueprint for implementing SAP S/4HANA to move a utility from reactive/time-based maintenance to predictive maintenance.
I mapped the TO-BE process in BPMN, aligned SAP modules (PM, MM, Fiori) to roles, and wrote an implementation plan that balances technology, process, and change.

Tip: Open the SVG first for a quick visual, then read the DOCX for the full story.

Highlights

Process improvement + redesign: from reactive work orders to IIoT → Digital Twin → predictive insights → automated SAP PM work orders

Tighter orchestration: PM triggers → MM checks stock/BOM/procurement → Technicians execute via Fiori → Closure & analytics

Business value: reduced unplanned downtime, better parts availability, faster field turnaround, audit-ready traceability

Pragmatic rollout: pilot first, change champions, role-based training, data governance & integration checklist

SAP & Methods

ERP: SAP S/4HANA (PM, MM), SAP Fiori

Modeling: BPMN 2.0 (pools/lanes, events, data stores)

Industry 4.0: IIoT telemetry, Digital Twin, predictive analytics

Delivery: phased implementation, stakeholder engagement, risk & change management
